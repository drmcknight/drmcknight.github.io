We stayed off of Pearl Street which happened to be about a 10 minute drive away from the Flat Irons. I can't believe this is just in people's back yards.

I hiked up to the Royal Arch during one of Cal's naps. It was definitely worth the effort!

We drove out to Estes Park during a blizzard. This was Cal's first time playing in snow!
