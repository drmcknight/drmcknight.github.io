According to Dan North, our daily stand-ups have been missing the point. I've always _felt_ that daily stand-ups were lacking something but could never articulate why. It's a good thing Dan can!

As the video suggests, I collect status throughout the day and give a report the next morning. This takes all of two minutes. The rest of stand-up is dedicated to discussing how we're going to "seize the day". I've only tried this for a few weeks but feedback so far has only been positive.

A word of warning: if you're going to try this, give status on work items, not individuals. I did this for the first few days and it was just as awkward and ineffective as the old stand-up format!
