Our candidates are often asked what their number one rule is. It's a good question that can lead to some interesting insights. I'm not sure if I'd be able to give a good answer on the spot though. Lucky for me, I'm not in an interview so I get to take all the time I want.

My number one rule is "less, but better". I'm always chucking things out and pairing things down. It's a talent I learned from my stepdad and is essentially my favorite thing to do.
