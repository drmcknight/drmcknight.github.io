We've recently made a few subtle adjustments to the pre-screening bits of our hiring process. Candidates are screened much faster and I dread the process much less. 

## Work as a Team
I would often take forever reviewing a candidate due to analysis paralysis or whatnot. Having another perspective around made it much easier to skip over distracting details and hone in on what's important.

## Iterate on Questions
Use the results of past interviews to find and remove low-value questions. We recently removed "what are you not interested in doing?". This was a back-end position so nearly every candidate answered "front-end".

## Video Chat
"Blink" by Malcom Gladwell probably has a lot to say about this. I simply enjoyed our screening interviews much more after we started video chatting with candidates.
