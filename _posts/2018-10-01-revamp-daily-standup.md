We're trying out "T-Boi's" stand-up format to great effect. Throughout the day I'm gathering status from each of my team members through interactions that happen already. The next morning, we all get together and I fill everyone in on the state of everything. If something's status has changed, the relevant team members update the group and then we shift to talking about what we need to do to have a successful day. This usually takes no more than 5 minutes and everyone has a much better grasp on where we're headed.
