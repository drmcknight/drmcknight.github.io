Candidates are often asked what their number one rule is. It's a good question that can lead to some interesting insights, given the answerer has enough time to think about it. Lucky for me, I'm not in an interview so I get to take all the time I want to think of my best answer.

From the things I own to the work I do, my number one rule is "Fewer, but better". A close second would be "less is more". I'm always chucking things out and pairing things down. It's a talent I learned from my stepdad and is essentially my favorite thing to do.

Here's a bit of anecdotal evidence:

Holly and I got a few terrible wedding presents that we didn't know what to do with. Well, I did but she didn't. While she was out one day I tossed it all in the trash and started mowing the yard. Half way through the mow I spot her standing off in the distance, staring at me coldly holding the problems that I had solved in her hands. Back in the house they went. I waited a few years and took them to a thrift store or something. I may have lost the battle but I won the war!
