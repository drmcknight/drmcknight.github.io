Some friends and I spent the day walking around Greeter Falls in Altamont Tennessee. The drive from Huntsville was only an hour and 45 minutes and the weather was amazing. The waterfalls are only a 5-10 minute hike from the parking lot. I guess we were lucky that the waterfalls were so incredible because a lady that we ran into said that they were barely a trickle a few days prior. I'll have to make sure it has been rainy on my next trip.
