We had a great time at the beach despite having car trouble on the way there (Thanks [Hatfield's Auto Parts and Service](http://www.autorepairshophomewoodal.com/))! It didn't take Callum long to warm up to the ocean. By the second day he was running all over the place waving at strangers for uncomfortable lengths of time.

Holly and I only got two hours of sleep our last night there due to Cal shenanigans. I had to tape my eyelids to my forehead for the drive home. Cal slept nearly the whole way.
