We had the opportunity to visit Ft. Walton Beach this past weekend! My Mom has been working in Ft. Walton for a couple of weeks so she invited us to come visit. Thanks, Mom! On the way there before we were able to make it through Birmingham, the car went into "limp home mode" due to something having to do with a timing valve. It was pretty interesting trying to drive on the interstate only going 50 MPH. We are very grateful to have found [Hatfield's Auto Parts and Service](http://www.autorepairshophomewoodal.com/) who shifted their day around to get us back on the road.

Once at the beach, Callum was very uncertain about the ocean. Probably because I put him directly in it. It wasn't long before he was running all over the place and waving at strangers for awkward lengths of time.

I grew up going to the Gulfarium so it was nice to take Callum.

Holly and I only got two hours of sleep our last night there due to Cal shenanigans. I had to tape my eyelids to my forehead for the drive home. Cal slept nearly the whole way.
