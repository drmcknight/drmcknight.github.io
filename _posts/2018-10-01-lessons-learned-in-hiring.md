## Work as a Team
Hiring should be a team sport. Having another set of eyes while reviewing resumes or grading take-home tests was invaluable throughout the entire process. When I’ve been psyched about a candidate, teammates would point out something I missed (and vice versa).

## Video Conference Whenever Possible
You pick up on many subtle cues when talking face-to-face. Someone may be saying all the right words but their face gives away that they’re BSing.

## Take-Home Tests
Give a take-home test and grade it objectively but take the results with grain of salt. The sum total of the test should give you a decent starting place for the follow-up discussion. Don’t let the take-home test define the candidate.
## Sell the Role
The candidate should be informed enough about the current state of the role but focus discussions around where the role/product/team is headed.

## Iterate on Interview Questions
If you aren't getting the type of answer you are looking for on a particular question. Don't be afraid to change it or remove it altogether.
