I recently filled a role on my team that I have been trying to fill for well over a year. The process prior to the on-site interview was needlessly laborious. We made a few tweaks to the process towards the end that really moved things along.

## Work as a Team
I would often take forever reviewing a take-home test or resume due to being hung up on some insignificant detail. Having another perspective around made it much easier to skip over distracting details and hone in on what's important about a candidate.

## Iterate on Interview Questions
If you aren't getting the type of answer you are looking for on a particular question. Don't be afraid to change it or remove it altogether.

## Take-Home Tests
Give a take-home test and grade it objectively but take the results with grain of salt. The sum total of the test should give you a decent starting place for the follow-up discussion. Don’t let the take-home test define the candidate.

## Prefer Video Chat
You pick up on many subtle cues when talking face-to-face. Someone may be saying all the right words but their face gives away that they’re BSing.
