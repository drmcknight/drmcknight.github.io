I recently filled a role on my team that I have been trying to fill for well over a year. The process prior to the on-site interview was needlessly laborious. We made a few improvements that took me from dreading new resumes to enjoying the whole process.

## Work as a Team
I would often take forever reviewing a candidate due to being hung up on some insignificant detail. Having another perspective around made it much easier to skip over distracting details and hone in on what's important.

## Iterate on Interview Questions
If you aren't getting the type of answer you are looking for on a particular question. Don't be afraid to change it or remove it altogether.

## Take-Home Tests
Have candidates create a small, simple application to showcase their ability. Be respectful of the candidate's time here as the app will be thrown away. Once you've created the test, create an objective score card to grade the test. You don't want to waste hours staring at an application trying to figure out how you _feel_ about it. Lastly, a candidate should never fail the take-home test without a follow-up conversation. Don't go into lots of detail about what they got right/wrong. Just glean a few questions from their application and have them lead you through their thought process in making the app. We've found that a seemingly bad test can look a lot better when the candidate walks you through it.

## Prefer Video Chat
"Blink" by Malcom Gladwell probably has a lot to say about this. I simply enjoyed our screening interviews much more after we started video chatting with candidates.
