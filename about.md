Professionally, I love breaking large problems down into small, deliverable pieces. I've spent a majority of my career looking for ways to write excellent, maintainable applications. I don't think there's any one good way but I've amassed enough tools to be successful.

Personally, I am a husband and a dad. I enjoy The Lord of the Rings, Gaming, and writing Software.

I currently work at [Curse](https://www.curse.com) doing all I can to make it even better.
